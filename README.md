The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board. The objective is to eat the food that appears on the board while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging.

## Features

- Game Logic: The game is implemented using JavaScript to handle the logic of snake movement, food generation, collision detection, and scoring.
- Styling: CSS is used to style the game board and elements, providing a visual representation of the game.
- Keyboard Input: JavaScript captures keyboard inputs to control the snake's movement.
